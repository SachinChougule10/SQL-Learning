--  ORDER BY :- you can tell SQL to SELECT something and ORDER the data it returns BY another column from the table.
-- ORDER BY allows you to alphabetically order any column.
-- using this below Query we will need to use 'LIKE' with every alphabet to get a alphabetical order till 'Z'

SELECT title, category FROM movie_table2
WHERE title LIKE 'A%' and category = 'family'
ORDER BY title;

-- Instead we can remove the LIKE part and use ORDER BY with category
-- ORDER BY without using BINARY (strict ASCII ordering) :- 
-- Even better, this list will include movies that begin with numbers in the title. Theyâ€™ll be first in the list.
